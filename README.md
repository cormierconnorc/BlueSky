##About the project

BlueSky is a basic 3D game written in C++ that utilizes OpenGL 3.3. This was my first project to use a newer version of OpenGL. The rendering code and the code required to load .OBJ files are based on the tutorial code available at [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org). 

In addition to OpenGL, this project utilizes the GLFW, GLEW, and GLM libraries.
